Game made by:
Giancarlo Mora
Anthony Mantini

Mark we think we deserve: 90%

Instructions:
//Press the escape key to start the game/get out of the pause menu
//Shoot at the dark grey wall in the game to progress further.
//In the big room only one of the cubes trigger the next room to open
//Then it is just a short jumping puzzle away from freedom


Explaination of deserved mark:
Although our game is not the cleanest looking and most
visually stunning we put a lot of effort into making 
a good GameSceneManager/Backbone to our game using
tutorials online as well as the Unity Website itself
in order to ensure we could build up a game of much greater
value. We ended up spending a lot of time trying to
make sure that we had the backbone implemented efficiently
and trying to add more functions into the game but due to
us thinking too big we ended up not having enough time to
actually input the all the stuff we prepared for. So, even
though our game may not look the best the effort that we
put into it makes us believe that we deserve the 90% grade.

On a side note, there are 2 scenes in the unity file, the 
first one has our rough testing of the games features from 
earlier in development, the second has the actual game we aimed 
to make in it with all the extra code and such. We hope that
you enjoy it!
